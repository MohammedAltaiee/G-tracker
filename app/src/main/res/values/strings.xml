    <string name="abouttext">G-tracker is a device capable of measuring how full a garbage can is and
        transmitting it onto an application where users (employees) can consult to know which garbage
        bin needs changing. It also acts as a data collection for a commercial area to potentially modify
        the location of garbage cans that are often empty, or add garbage cans to locations where they
        are often full. It is a project born out of Concordia University in Montreal, Canada by
        6 computer and electrical engineers. Our hopes are that this project will facilitate the job
        of all cleaning personel and further keep the world clean. Let us know if you have any
        questions or suggestions by contacting us through our contact us page.</string>
